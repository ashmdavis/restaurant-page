# 🍔 Restaurant Page

This is webiste was created for a fake burger fastfood restauraunt called Bussin' Burger Joint. It was created for an assigment for The Odin Project curriculumn. This project was created to demonstrate the use of drynamic DOM manipulation and Webpack module bundling.

Check out the live demo [here]().

**Built With:**
- `JavaScript`
- `CSS`
- `HTML5`
- `Webpack`
- `npm`

## Project Requirements

- DOM elements should be created using JavaScript.
- Webpack Bundling

## Features

- Webpack bundling to keep assets organized into one package.
- DOM elements to allow dynamic content rendering.
- Tabbed navigation for Desktop use.
- Hamburger menu navigation for mobile devices.

## The Process

- I started out with looking at other fastfood websites and sketched out an idea of how it would look. Using DOM elements it was important for me to know what the page should look like. This way I can have an idea of how best to organize the JS code.
- Though the requirement was to create each element via JavaScript. There are some elements on the page that should remain static on the page no matter what tab the user clicks on. For this reason I created the page Header and the Footer using HTML.
- The keep organization, each page was created with there on JavaScript file and then imported to a single JS file which serves as the entry point for which Webpack will start building.

## What I Learned

I feel very comfortable with working with DOM Elements. Because of this, I was able to put a little extra care in praciting organization without any techicnal setbacks.

### 🎨 Styling Files are just as important as JS files

- One thing I did not consider in the beginning is how messy CSS files can get very quickly. Using Webpacks not only is great for using mulitiple JS files but can also be used to give each their own CSS file.
